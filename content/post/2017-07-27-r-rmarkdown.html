<h1>What Is This?!</h1>
<p>My name is Matthew R. Buras, and this is my personal site! This site was built using RStudio with the blogdown package and the site is hosted for free using GitHub.</p>
<p>Linked on this site are my Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub. If you are looking for current information on me, LinkedIn should be up to date. My twitter is a good resource to find out who you should follow if you are interested in statistics.</p>
<p>I have yet to decide my purpose for this site. This is an on-going experiment!</p>
